# Phase2 Theme Core

Here is the core configuration used in [Pattern Lab Starter](http://github.com/phase2/pattern-lab-starter); changes to how that works most likely would be submitted here as a Pull Request. Ideally, the changes to how a Pattern Lab Starter install works would be done by passing in a different `config`. 

This is new and a work in progress; more documentation is in need and planned â€“ PRs welcome!
