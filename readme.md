# Phase2 Theme Core

Here is the core configuration used in [Pattern Lab Starter](http://github.com/phase2/pattern-lab-starter); changes to how that works most likely would be submitted here as a Pull Request. Ideally, the changes to how a Pattern Lab Starter install works would be done by passing in a different `config`. 

**More docs in [`docs/`](https://github.com/phase2/p2-theme-core/tree/master/docs) folder â€“ these docs are [hosted in Read the Docs](http://p2-theme-core.readthedocs.org)!**
