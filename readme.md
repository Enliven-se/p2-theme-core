**This is one of two pieces of our themes:**

- [`generator-p2-theme`](https://github.com/phase2/generator-p2-theme) (aka `yo p2-theme`) - this asks questions and then creates new files to be committed to start off a project's theme.
- [`p2-theme-core`](https://github.com/phase2/p2-theme-core) (this repo) - the core gulp tasks that handles most of the theme's automation.


# Phase2 Theme Core

Here is the core gulp tasks used in our themes that are generated by `yo p2-theme`. Ideally, the changes to how a theme install works would be done by passing in a different `config.yml`. 

**More docs in [`docs/`](https://github.com/phase2/p2-theme-core/tree/master/docs) folder â€“ these docs are [hosted in Read the Docs](http://p2-theme-core.readthedocs.org)!**

# Features

- Scss => CSS compiling with Libsass, PostCSS, linting, and SourceMaps
- Pattern Lab Twig compiling & BrowserSync live reload and style injection
- SVG => Font Icons compiling with support for adding mixins and classes to Scss along with a demo page in Pattern Lab
- JS compiling via Babel, linting and aggregation
- Drupal file watching to trigger Drush cache clears

All is easily configurable by changing values in your `config.yml` file in your project. These values are merged into the `default.config.yml` file - look there for the available options and defaults.
